                <h4>Description</h4>      
                <p>Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Most cases are caused by bacteria or viruses, but some can be due to certain medications or illnesses. The goal of our study is to develop user-friendly myoelectric-a latest technology prostetic leg that uses electrodes to sense muscular impulses in the residual limb. <br /><br />
                <b>Context of This Research</b><br />
                A little boy who lost his legs to meningitis has seen his life transformed with a new pair of artificial limbs. Robbie Jones, now eight, walked down the aisle with his parents on their wedding day in 2009 when he was aged two, despite having his left leg amputated below the knee and his right amputated above the knee. After contracting the killer brain disease at just 22 months old, he made an amazing recovery, and has just been fitted with lighter ‘Bladerunner’ style prosthetic legs. They have seen him join in with PE classes at school, play football and go out on his skateboard.<br /><br />

                <b>Significance</b><br />
                
                Myoelectric for residual limbs are electronic control systems detecting muscular impulses and amplifying them to power electric motors that operate the prosthetic limb as though it were real.<br />

                <Br /><br />

                <b>Goals of the project</b><br />

                Our team has develeoped the first Myoelectric for the little boy who lost his legs to meningitis. As our experiment is successfull and life-changing for this boy, we stive to raise funding and manufacture high technology Myoelectric for other patients lacking functional hands.<br />
